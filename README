MATLABrb-Visualization of AGC from SiGe

###### Descriptions of folders

*ComparisonPlotScripts: Scripts that give template for plotting two different SiGe systems' data together. (Not updated for a while, do not use).

*EmailFunctions: All scripts that are related to sending emails, or gathering plots for the emails.

*HelpfulFunctions: Majority of scripts that do a single task that makes the main scripts easier to understand.

*NT1065 Scripts: Scripts for NT1065 SiGe analysis (Still in development, do not use).

*SDRtracking: Scripts used to track GPS Intermediate Frequency(IF) Signal. Used to plot C/N0 on spectrum plots and spectrograms.

*Unused: Currently unused scripts but could potentially have use in future.

###### Descriptions of Main Scripts

*addpaths.m: Tells matlab to look for needed functions/scripts in all of the above folders.

*AGC_Plotting.m: Function script to plot the AGC data. Works well with any time frame of data.

*background_loop.m: Main script that is started by init.m that runs the analysis of the AGC data at every end of UTC day if desired, or just analyzes any unanalyzed files. Also sends out emails of triggers, errors, and weekly reports.

*calibration.mat: Important calibration data that gives the conversion between AGC voltage and white power noise in dB. Loaded in the init.m script.

***init.m: Script where all settings are set and the script that you run to start the analysis. Many important settings like location of files, trigger threshold, email notification etc.

*initNT.m: Script that would start the analysis of NT1065 AGC data just like init.m. (Still in development).

*spectro.m: Performs fourier transform of AGC data to create spectrogram data.

*unpack_cplx.m: Unpacks the GPS data so that it can be easily parsed/understood.
