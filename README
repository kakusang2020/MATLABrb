*AGC_stats : compute some statistics on the last AGC file found in the ~/Jammer/data folder and write it in a file

*background_loop : is a loop executed every 5min that check if new files are available in the data.
  If so it generates a report on the event and a plot of the AGC data of the day. The figures are put in ~/Jammer/data/figures

*calibration.mat : is a matlab matrix that contain the AGC value as a function of the power of the white noise injected in the module.
 It was generated experimentally.

*datetick_custom : is like datetick function in matlab but use Unix timestamp instead of datenum and plot both UTC time and local time.

*getAgcfromFolder : is a function get the AGC values of a period of time going in the folder of data and reading in all the AGC files
 to find the data

*init : is executed by background_loop at first. It contains the parameters of the station (folders, threshold, logname, IP and timezone)

*spectro_cplx : generate spectrogram directly from packed complex IF data

*start_matlab : is a shell script that start matlab and execute background_loop in a background task

*unpack_cplx : unpack the IF complex data.
